This is a design for a 2-stage model rocket that will boost a basic 
ESP32-based telemetry board (accelerometer, altimeter, barometric pressure 
sensor, and temperature sensor, along with a real time clock.  The telemetry 
readings are saved on the MicroSD card on the TTGO-T1 board.

The first stage is a four engine cluster, with 1 E12-0 and three D12-3 
engines.  The second stage takes one E12-8 engine.
